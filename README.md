# Web penetration test lab

This is a set of POCs that utilize multiple vulnerabilities I found in a pentest
lab imitating a social network.

The lab was presented in 2 forms:
1. An electron app utilizing a custom tcp protocol.
2. A website.

No source code was available for either the client or the server and the whole
protocol, for both versions was fully reverse engineered by me from the clients. \
The [poc.py](./poc.py) contains a client implementation I wrote for both versions
and a menu allowing utilizing these clients for normal usage and exploitation of
lab's vulnerabilities.
